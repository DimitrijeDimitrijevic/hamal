We keep state of each date in socket assings.

When check in is changed we update socket check_in_date assign, with this we can access it in check_out_date change
This also applies when check_out_date is change
This also applies on whole reservation validation in validate event.

Before querying for available rooms, we need to make sure that dates are in present time or future.

In form we should also handle in validation event if the check_in, check_out date are in the past
